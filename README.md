# Rugby World XV

## By Stephen Whittington

Rugby World XV is a single page application built with the flask
web framework along with Mongodb for data storage. It allows users
to import their favorite players and create an allstar/rugby world cup squad,
which they can edit anytime and add as many players as they want.
The site is easy to navigate with a simple layout and is responsive on
mobile and desktop.

## UX Process

[Link to my figma mockup](https://github.com/StephenWhittington/rugby-world-xv/blob/master/static/images/Pick%20Your%20World%20XV.png)

I started with a desktop mockup using figma by focusing on the core aspects
of what the user should experience, a well responsive and easy to use webpage.
With easy navigation,forms and input fields for the user to experience, The user results
then returned for them to read update or delete. The website is aimed at the fanbase of rugby
but it is easily navigated by anyone.

The user wants to be able to add players of their choice and create a team
that is unique to them. And this webpage helps them do that with its simple layout
and navigation, Also with its easy to use forms and input fields.
