# Rugby World XV

## By Stephen Whittington

Rugby World XV is a single page application built with the flask
web framework along with Mongodb for data storage. It allows users
to import their favorite players and create an allstar/rugby world cup squad,
which they can edit anytime and add as many players as they want.
The site is easy to navigate with a simple layout and is responsive on
mobile and desktop.
